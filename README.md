# hello-world
Hey all,

My name is Bensen Guyer. I've been in IT forever but trying to swing over to development.
I've been working with Unix/Linux for roughly 10 years and enjoy being creative; maybe I should have been an artist. That aside I'm doing a lot of home practice and inovation while migrating my mind to the cloud and pratices of development.
